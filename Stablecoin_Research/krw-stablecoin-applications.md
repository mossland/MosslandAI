Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets (often fiat currencies) to minimize price volatility. While **USD-pegged stablecoins** (like USDT, USDC) dominate globally, interest is growing in stablecoins pegged to other currencies, including the **Korean won (KRW)**. South Korea’s new administration has signaled strong support for a **KRW-backed stablecoin**, viewing it as a way to spur fintech innovation and enhance the won’s digital usage. Lawmakers are fast-tracking regulations (the proposed *Digital Asset Basic Act*) to legalize won-based stablecoins, even lowering issuer capital requirements from ₩5 billion to ₩0.5 billion to encourage participation. This policy momentum has fueled market excitement – for example, Kakao Pay’s stock price surged 70% in anticipation of a KRW stablecoin rollout.

Despite some past skepticism that “Korean won stablecoins lack clear applications” compared to USD stablecoins, the landscape is shifting as new use cases emerge. **KRW-pegged stablecoins** could play pivotal roles in various industries. In this report, we explore their application areas, business models, market potential, and real or speculative use cases in **AI**, **metaverse**, **VR/AR**, and **gaming**. Domestic (South Korean) examples are highlighted alongside global cases, illustrating how a won-backed stablecoin might be implemented.

To provide a clear overview, we organize the discussion by industry and summarize key points in the comparison table below.

Below, we dive into each industry in detail, with examples and models illustrating how KRW-pegged stablecoins could be utilized.

## AI Industry: Stablecoins as the Payment Layer for AI Services

AI systems increasingly operate autonomously, but traditional payment networks aren’t built for machine-to-machine transactions. This is where stablecoins shine. **Stablecoins are essentially becoming the payment layer of the AI economy**. They enable instant, programmable transactions that AI agents or algorithms can trigger without human intervention. A KRW-pegged stablecoin could allow AI services in South Korea (or serving Korean users) to transact in local currency on blockchain rails, combining the stability of fiat with the automation of crypto.

**Business Model:** In an AI-driven marketplace, microtransactions may occur at high frequency – for example, an AI paying a few won worth of stablecoin to access an API or data point. Credit cards or bank transfers can’t handle such **micropayments** efficiently, but stablecoins can settle tiny payments in real time at near-zero cost. This opens up new business models: AI services could charge per request or per second of computation, debiting a user’s (or another AI’s) stablecoin balance programmatically. Platforms facilitating these payments (exchanges, wallets, or “Wallet-as-a-Service” providers) could earn fees on high volumes of small transactions. Additionally, stablecoin issuers could earn interest on reserves and share some yield with users or service providers, incentivizing adoption.

**Use Cases & Examples:** Globally, we already see early examples of **AI and stablecoin integration**. Visa has prototyped an **“Agent Pay”** system where autonomous AI-powered wallets settle payments with each other based on pre-set logic. Similarly, Coinbase introduced “**x402**,” a protocol that lets AI agents pay for API calls using the USDC stablecoin. Stripe is also merging AI capabilities with its crypto stablecoin infrastructure to create a **programmable finance OS** for developers. These examples use USD stablecoins, but the same concepts could apply to a KRW stablecoin – allowing Korean AI startups and researchers to plug into a machine-friendly payment network denominated in won.

A KRW-pegged stablecoin could, for instance, be used by Korean AI cloud platforms or data marketplaces. Consider a marketplace where companies share AI models or datasets: consumers (human or AI) could pay in a KRW stablecoin per use or per download, ensuring the price remains stable relative to KRW. This would lower currency conversion frictions for domestic transactions and hedge against crypto volatility (important for budgeting in corporate settings). The **market potential** here aligns with the overall growth of AI services – as AI adoption soars, the volume of automated transactions could skyrocket. Stablecoins provide the needed **scalability and programmability**. As one commentary noted, *“AI doesn’t just need APIs – it needs money movement. Stablecoins, with their instant, permissionless design, are perfectly built for autonomous transactions”*. In short, KRW stablecoins could become the **fuel for AI-driven commerce** in Korea, powering anything from IoT device payments to AI content purchases, all while keeping value in local currency.

## Metaverse: Powering Virtual Economies with Stable Value

The **metaverse** – immersive virtual worlds and digital communities – has its own burgeoning economy of virtual real estate, digital goods, and services. Many metaverse projects currently use cryptocurrencies or platform-specific tokens for transactions (e.g. Decentraland’s MANA, The Sandbox’s SAND), but these can be highly volatile. This volatility poses a barrier to mainstream adoption for commerce. **Stablecoins offer a solution**: a currency that is digital and decentralized, yet *price-stable*, making it ideal as the **medium of exchange in virtual environments**.

In fact, analysts have pointed out that *stablecoins are well-suited as the circulating currency inside metaverse ecosystems*. Using actual national fiat money directly in a metaverse is impractical (due to settlement delays and geographical/payment barriers), but a fiat-pegged stablecoin combines real-world value with virtual world portability. A user could trust that the 10,000 KRW they have in a metaverse wallet today will still be worth 10,000 KRW of purchasing power tomorrow, which is crucial for pricing virtual assets and services reasonably. As a columnist in Maeil Business Newspaper mused, *in the future it may feel natural to put on VR glasses and pay with stablecoins at a virtual store* – a scenario highlighting how everyday shopping experiences could migrate to VR platforms using stablecoins as the **transactional glue**.

**Use Cases & Examples:** Some global platforms have started experimenting with stablecoin integration. For instance, NFT marketplaces (integral to many metaverses) often allow listings in stablecoins like USDC to facilitate sales without price confusion. We can imagine **Korean metaverse platforms** embracing a KRW stablecoin similarly. **Zepeto**, a popular South Korean metaverse app, or gaming metaverses from companies like Netmarble and Nexon could adopt a KRW-based stablecoin for buying avatar items, tickets to virtual concerts, or tipping creators. This would let Korean users transact in their familiar currency while on-chain. On the **global stage**, even Meta (Facebook) had explored stable-value digital currency for its metaverse projects (though their Diem project was USD-based and ultimately shelved). Nonetheless, the concept stands – a stablecoin can serve as the **“metaverse money.”**

South Korea’s policymakers see this potential too. Notably, the ruling Democratic Party has discussed leveraging a *“Korean Stablecoin”* in the content and entertainment sector – specifically mentioning **K-pop music platforms and webtoon (digital comics) platforms** as places where a KRW stablecoin could be used for payments. The idea is to **establish a Korean-issued stablecoin as a standard payment method for digital content**, reducing reliance on US-dollar stablecoins like Tether that currently dominate crypto payments. This strategy is as much about economic sovereignty as business: if virtual worlds and online content markets run on USD-pegged tokens, the Korean won could be sidelined; a KRW-pegged stablecoin aims to keep value within a won-denominated system even in cyberspace.

For metaverse businesses, the **business models** around a KRW stablecoin could include: transaction fees on marketplace trades, listing fees payable in stablecoin, or even interest earnings if user balances are held (much like how payment apps might earn float on stored money). A metaverse platform might also issue its own KRW stablecoin in partnership with a bank or fintech, essentially acting as a **digital mint** for the community’s economy (subject to regulatory approval). Such a stablecoin could be *interoperable across multiple games or worlds*, potentially creating a shared currency for a network of metaverse experiences. The **market potential** is significant: the metaverse market is projected to be **hundreds of billions of dollars** by mid-decade, and if a fraction of those transactions funnel through a stablecoin, that’s a huge volume of payments. By 2025, we expect virtual spaces to become a vital part of daily life and industry, and a KRW stablecoin could ride that wave, embedding the won into global virtual commerce.

## VR/AR Applications: Enhancing Immersive Experiences and Commerce

**Virtual Reality (VR)** and **Augmented Reality (AR)** are technologies closely linked to the metaverse, but they also stand on their own in sectors like entertainment, retail, and advertising. KRW-pegged stablecoins can add value here by enabling seamless, secure payments and rewards in immersive contexts. In AR and VR, users often interact in real time and globally – a stablecoin ensures the currency they use is not fluctuating mid-experience and can be shared across borders (with KRW stablecoin specifically benefiting Korean users or Korean-oriented services).

**VR Commerce:** Virtual reality shopping and events are an emerging field. For example, VR malls or showrooms allow users to browse and purchase products virtually. Integrating a stablecoin payment system would let a user complete a transaction on the spot in VR. If the user is in Korea or a Korean platform, paying with a KRW stablecoin would be as straightforward as a swipe of a VR interface. This removes friction – no need to take off the headset to confirm a mobile payment or credit card, and no worry that the token price will change by the time you check out. The stability and programmability of stablecoins could also allow *smart contract escrow*: imagine buying a virtual service (like a VR concert ticket or an in-game item) and the payment is held in stablecoin escrow and released when the event happens or item is delivered to your inventory.

**AR Rewards and Local Experiences:** Augmented reality often blends the virtual with the physical world. One practical use case could be **AR location-based marketing** – for instance, a retailer or city tourism board runs an AR treasure hunt where participants collect tokens at landmarks. Using a KRW stablecoin as the reward token means players are earning something that has real, stable value (redeemable for cash or purchases) rather than a one-off game token. This could increase participation because people trust the reward’s worth. We are already seeing glimpses of such models: some projects have used crypto tokens to reward users for visiting locations or scanning AR codes. A stablecoin makes the reward immediately spendable or cashable. A domestic example is hypothetical but plausible: a company like **Naver** (which has AR navigation and shopping apps) could introduce a won-pegged coin to reward users for using AR services – those rewards might be small (a few hundred KRW), so a stablecoin handles that efficiently and can be tied into Naver’s payment ecosystem.

Additionally, AR is being used in **gaming and real-world simulations** (think Pokémon Go style games or AR overlays in theme parks). A KRW stablecoin could serve as the **in-game currency** in these AR games, enabling players to buy upgrades or trade items with confidence in the currency’s value. This is especially beneficial if the game targets a Korean user base – users could top up their accounts with KRW stablecoins that reflect their real-world currency, making it easier mentally (no exchange rate math or volatility). It also simplifies compliance, as the stablecoin could be designed to follow local e-money regulations, essentially functioning like a **digital prepaid currency**.

**Example & Pilot:** One relevant domestic project is **Mossland**, a Korean AR/VR gaming platform that originally let users trade virtual real estate tied to real-world locations. Mossland has its own cryptocurrency (MOC), but the company’s research arm has explored stablecoin implementations. The idea would be to introduce a KRW-pegged stablecoin within the Mossland ecosystem to facilitate transactions (buying virtual property, AR items, etc.) with low volatility and easier fiat on-boarding. While details are still speculative, such a move could increase user trust (no fear that their in-app currency will crash in value) and make it simpler to integrate with payment gateways (since a KRW stablecoin can be accepted by exchanges or converted through wallets within the app). For Mossland or similar AR ventures, the stablecoin’s **business model** might involve them partnering with a financial entity to issue the coin and perhaps earning a portion of transaction fees or interest on reserves. Given the government’s push, Korean startups may find support in launching these pilots. Indeed, there was news of a local blockchain firm (Parameta) and a conglomerate (Insco) teaming up to develop a KRW-based stablecoin for *regional currency* use cases, which hints that even AR-driven local economies (like a city-wide coupon system delivered via AR apps) could become reality.

In summary, VR/AR stands to benefit from KRW stablecoins by adding a **trusted, convenient financial layer** to immersive tech. Market potential will grow as AR/VR adoption does – which is expected to accelerate alongside advancements in headsets and AR glasses. By tying the won to these experiences, Korea can cultivate a digital economy in VR/AR that keeps value circulating within its currency realm, aligning with the broader goal of *won internationalization through tokenization*.

## Gaming: Stablecoins in Game Economies and Play-to-Earn Models

The gaming industry, including the booming **Web3 gaming** sector, is another fertile ground for stablecoin integration. In online games and virtual worlds, players are already familiar with the concept of virtual currencies (gold, gems, points, etc.). Traditionally, these are either fixed in value (but confined to a single game) or tradeable crypto tokens (which fluctuate in value). **A stablecoin combines the best of both**: it can act as a universal in-game currency that holds stable real-world value.

**Why Stable Value Matters:** Consider the issues that arose with early play-to-earn games like Axie Infinity – players were earning tokens that could swing wildly in price, complicating the economics and even livelihoods of those players. If rewards or in-game earnings are denominated in a stablecoin (especially one pegged to the local currency of the player base), it provides *predictability*. A player can spend or cash out their game earnings without worrying that a market crash will wipe out half the value overnight. This is particularly important in South Korea, where gaming is a massive industry and there’s interest in **P2E (play-to-earn)** if regulations allow. A KRW stablecoin could enable Korean players to earn “real” (stable) money through gameplay that is instantly usable in the wider economy, bridging gaming with finance.

**Use Cases in Gaming:** There are multiple ways a KRW stablecoin could be deployed:

* **In-Game Marketplace:** Games with player-driven economies (MMORPGs, for instance) could price items in a KRW stablecoin. A sword might cost ₩5,000 in stablecoin rather than some unpredictable amount of a volatile token. Players can better gauge the real-world value of items, and trading becomes more grounded. Game publishers could take a transaction cut in stablecoin.
* **E-Sports and Tournaments:** Prize pools for e-sports could be paid out in KRW stablecoin, simplifying distribution and ensuring the prize doesn’t lose value by the time players receive it. For global tournaments held in Korea, a KRW stablecoin could be a convenient settlement currency.
* **Cross-Game Portability:** If multiple games or a whole platform (like the Kakao or Naver gaming platforms) adopted the same KRW stablecoin, players could transfer value between games. Sell an item in Game A for 100 KRW stablecoins, then use that to buy DLC in Game B. This creates a unified **gaming economy** where the won is digitally native across experiences.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Korean law currently restricts converting game money to cash (to avoid gambling, etc.), but a regulated stablecoin might navigate some of these issues if positioned as a legitimate digital asset. The government appointing figures like Kim Yong-beom (a former finance vice-minister with blockchain expertise) suggests they are looking at how to let innovative uses like stablecoins in gaming flourish while maintaining oversight.

**Business Model for Publishers:** Game companies could benefit in several ways. First, by issuing or adopting a stablecoin, they might get **float income** – the reserves (actual KRW deposits or equivalents) backing the stablecoin can earn interest. This is how some stablecoin issuers (like Tether or Circle) make substantial revenue, effectively turning idle player cash into a yield. Second, as mentioned, transaction fees: the game can charge a small fee on every marketplace sale or transfer in stablecoin. Third, it can boost user spending – when players are less worried about token volatility, they may be more willing to spend money in-game (it feels more like spending cash than gambling on a crypto that might moon or tank). This could increase the overall revenue from microtransactions.

There’s also a **security and fraud reduction** angle: stablecoin transactions on a blockchain are transparent and traceable (with pseudonymity), which can help reduce black-market trading or hacking issues that plague game currencies. With smart contracts, one could implement features like **escrow trades, lending of game items for yield**, etc., all denominated in stablecoin.

The **market potential** is enormous. South Korea has a huge gaming market, and globally gaming is a \$200+ billion industry. If even a slice of in-game transactions move on-chain via stablecoins, we’re talking about billions in stablecoin circulation for gaming items and services. Indeed, Korea’s new president has highlighted stablecoins in the same breath as other strategic tech sectors. Some in the industry have suggested stablecoins could soon become an industry “on an equal footing with AI or semiconductors” in terms of importance. That might be an ambitious claim, but it underscores the high hopes for stablecoins – including enabling new digital business models like those in gaming. By anchoring these activities to the KRW, Korea can both foster innovation and maintain monetary sovereignty in the digital realm.

## Conclusion and Outlook

KRW-pegged stablecoins hold **transformative potential** across AI, metaverse, VR/AR, and gaming industries. They marry the innovative features of cryptocurrency (speed, programmability, global reach) with the familiarity and stability of the Korean won. This combination can unlock new business models – from AI agents transacting autonomously, to gamers earning spendable rewards, to users shopping in VR – all without the friction of currency volatility or conversion. Market enthusiasm in Korea is evident: major tech and finance players are gearing up for stablecoins, and the government is crafting a legal framework to support them.

Real-world examples illustrate both current usage and the **speculative next steps**. Globally, USD-backed stablecoins are already feeding into emerging trends (AI integrations, metaverse payments, game currencies), providing a template that a KRW stablecoin can follow. Domestically, initiatives like Kaia’s won-pegged stablecoin launch, content platforms eyeing stablecoin payments, and fintech firms rallying behind the concept show that Korea is positioning to be at the forefront of this stablecoin era. Experts note that tokenizing the won could dramatically increase its global mobility and help Korea tackle structural challenges in finance – a hint that beyond niche applications, KRW stablecoins could play a role in international trade and finance (e.g. cheaper remittances and exports settlement in KRW) if broadly adopted.

Of course, there are challenges ahead. Regulatory clarity is crucial (and in progress), as is ensuring robust reserve management so a KRW stablecoin is truly trustworthy (learning from past failures elsewhere). User education and user experience will matter too: average consumers should find using a stablecoin as easy as current digital payments. The **competition** will also be stiff – USD stablecoins are entrenched globally, and big companies could push their own tokens. Korea’s strategy, as indicated by policymakers, is to leverage the **won’s strength in a digital form** so that it isn’t overshadowed in the crypto economy. If successful, we could see a **financial paradigm shift** where stablecoins become mainstream in daily transactions and digital services, ushering in a new era of stablecoin adoption in Korea.

In summary, KRW-pegged stablecoins have the potential to **enhance business models** (through new revenue streams and more efficient operations) and unlock **market opportunities** (by engaging users in novel ways) in AI, metaverse, VR/AR, and gaming. They serve as a bridge between the physical won-based economy and the brave new world of digital platforms and virtual experiences. With both government backing and industry creativity, the coming years could see the won making its mark as a stable digital currency in realms once thought to be science fiction. South Korea’s proactive approach means the question is not *if* KRW stablecoins will be used in these industries, but *how soon and how widely*. The examples and cases discussed in this report suggest we’re on the cusp of seeing it all unfold.
