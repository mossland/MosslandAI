# Exploring the Role of KRW-Pegged Stablecoins in Korea: Policy, Technology, and Economic Implications

## Abstract

As the global landscape of digital currencies evolves, stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies have emerged as a critical infrastructure in decentralized finance (DeFi) and cross-border settlements. While USD-pegged stablecoins such as USDT and USDC dominate the international market, Korea has yet to implement a KRW-pegged stablecoin within its regulatory framework. This paper explores recent regulatory developments, market dynamics, and the strategic advantages of introducing a Korean won (KRW) stablecoin, offering a comparative analysis with USD stablecoins. We examine this issue from technological, economic, and policy perspectives, drawing implications for national monetary sovereignty and innovation.

## 1. Introduction

Stablecoins are digital assets designed to minimize price volatility by pegging their value to a reserve asset, such as fiat currency. Globally, USD-based stablecoins have become instrumental in digital asset trading and financial innovation. Korea, despite its advanced digital infrastructure and active crypto market, does not yet have a regulated KRW-pegged stablecoin. However, recent legislative and institutional developments indicate a shifting policy stance.

## 2. Regulatory Developments in Korea

### 2.1 Legislative Proposals

The Korean government and ruling party are advancing the "Digital Asset Basic Act" to provide a legal foundation for stablecoin issuance. Key elements include:

* Mandatory financial regulatory approval (by the Financial Services Commission)
* Capital adequacy requirements (minimum KRW 500 million for issuers)
* Real-time reserve disclosure and audit obligations
* Establishment of a Digital Asset Committee and Korea Digital Asset Association as supervisory bodies

### 2.2 Executive Policy Direction

President Lee Jae-myung and Presidential Policy Chief Kim Yong-beom have prioritized the institutionalization of KRW-pegged stablecoins. Kim argues that stablecoins should not be suppressed, but designed by public institutions to preserve monetary sovereignty. His background in finance and blockchain research positions him as a key architect of Korea’s forthcoming digital currency regime.

### 2.3 Central Bank Perspective

The Bank of Korea has voiced concerns over privately issued KRW stablecoins potentially undermining monetary policy. It advocates a cautious, phased approach—starting with commercial banks as authorized issuers. The central bank supports utilizing its experience from CBDC pilot programs (e.g., Project Han-Gang) to supervise reserve management and payment infrastructure.

### 2.4 Issuer Debate

There is debate over whether only banks should be allowed to issue KRW stablecoins. While the Bank of Korea supports a bank-centric model, fintech companies and blockchain developers advocate for broader participation under strict reserve and audit requirements. Proposed frameworks resemble EU’s MiCA regulation.

## 3. Market Dynamics and Institutional Readiness

### 3.1 Domestic Demand

USD-based stablecoins account for tens of trillions of KRW in monthly trading volume on Korean exchanges. This highlights strong latent demand for a KRW-denominated alternative, especially among retail and institutional crypto investors.

### 3.2 Industry Preparation

Leading Korean banks and fintech firms have formed consortia and working groups to prepare for regulated stablecoin issuance. Initiatives include:

* Bank-issued deposit tokens linked to central bank reserves (e.g., via Project Han-Gang)
* Private sector pilots of fully collateralized KRW stablecoins

## 4. Comparative Analysis: USD vs KRW Stablecoins

| Category        | USD Stablecoins (e.g., USDT/USDC)    | KRW Stablecoin (Proposed)                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Issuers         | Private fintech firms (non-bank)     | Licensed Korean entities (banks or fintechs)   |
| Regulation      | Fragmented (US), MiCA (EU)           | Integrated via Digital Asset Basic Act         |
| Collateral      | USD cash and U.S. Treasuries         | KRW cash and Korean government bonds           |
| Market Reach    | Global, used in DeFi and remittances | Korea-centric: trading, payments, regional use |
| Monetary Impact | Increases USD dominance              | Protects KRW demand, reduces capital outflow   |

## 5. Strategic Advantages of KRW-Pegged Stablecoins

### 5.1 Technological Advantages

* **Programmability**: Enables automated financial transactions (e.g., payroll, lending, settlements)
* **Transparency**: Enforces real-time proof-of-reserves and on-chain audits
* **Interoperability**: Bridges domestic systems with global DeFi infrastructure

### 5.2 Economic Advantages

* **Monetary Sovereignty**: Counters dollarization and protects KRW demand
* **Cost Reduction**: Reduces transaction and remittance costs
* **Innovation**: Spurs domestic fintech and blockchain ecosystem development

### 5.3 Policy Advantages

* **Risk Management**: Enables preemptive regulatory control
* **Data Sovereignty**: Keeps financial infrastructure and user data within national jurisdiction
* **Strategic Positioning**: Strengthens Korea’s leadership in digital financial governance

## 6. Conclusion

A regulated KRW-pegged stablecoin represents a unique opportunity for Korea to assert monetary sovereignty, stimulate fintech innovation, and reinforce national competitiveness in digital finance. Policymakers must balance innovation with oversight to ensure safe, scalable adoption.
