### Explanation of the Code

1. **Preprocessing (`preprocess_text`)**:
   - Uses spaCy to tokenize the input text into sentences.
   - Filters out very short sentences (less than 10 characters) to retain meaningful content.

2. **Summarization (`summarize_text`)**:
   - Uses the Hugging Face `pipeline` with the `t5-base` model to generate summaries.
   - `max_length` and `min_length` parameters control the summary length.

3. **Main Function**:
   - Demonstrates how to preprocess and summarize a sample DAO proposal.
   - Prints the cleaned text and generated summary.

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Install required libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install transformers spacy
     python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
     ```

You can expand this script to read proposal data from files or APIs and save the summaries to a database or file system. Let me know if you need further enhancements!
