# Recent Project Case Study on DAO and AI-Based Improvement Strategies

## Introduction

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) represent an innovative experiment that leverages blockchain technology and token-based governance to overcome the limitations of traditional organizational structures [1]. In a DAO, token holders directly participate in decision-making, and the organization operates automatically based on pre-defined rules embedded in smart contracts [1]. However, issues such as low voter participation, inefficient decision-making processes, and the concentration of power have been observed [1]. Recent cases from MakerDAO, Aave, and Arbitrum DAO have highlighted these challenges, prompting active discussions regarding potential solutions. Concurrently, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has spurred interest in integrating AI into DAO governance to enhance both efficiency and participation [7].

This paper analyzes recent DAO cases and proposes AI-based improvement strategies for DAO governance, while discussing the future outlook and associated risks.

## 1. Analysis of Recent DAO Cases

This section examines the characteristics and governance challenges of prominent DAOs such as MakerDAO, Aave DAO, and Arbitrum DAO. Table 1 provides a summary of the key features and governance issues identified in each case.

### 1.1 MakerDAO Case

MakerDAO operates the decentralized stablecoin DAI, with governance decisions (e.g., selection of collateral types and determination of stability fees) made by MKR token holders [1].

- **Strengths**:  
  MakerDAO has established an open financial system accessible to participants worldwide, thereby maintaining DAI’s peg to the U.S. dollar.
  
- **Issues**:  
  - The voting process is dominated by a small number of “whales,” which reduces the incentive for ordinary token holders to participate [1].  
  - The complexity of governance proposals hinders the ability of regular participants to fully understand the issues at stake [1].  
  - There has been criticism regarding the excessive influence of the organization’s founder [1].

To address these challenges, MakerDAO introduced its Endgame Plan during 2022–2023. This plan includes measures to incentivize MKR holders through new token economics (e.g., providing interest on staked governance tokens) and to improve governance efficiency by subdividing MakerDAO into several sub-DAOs. Discussions regarding the integration of AI technology are also underway [1].

### 1.2 Aave DAO Case

Aave is a leading DeFi lending protocol governed by the AAVE token [2].

- **Strengths**:  
  Aave offers decentralized lending services secured by various assets and features community-driven decision-making.

- **Issues**:  
  - The protocol suffers from low voter participation and high gas fees for on-chain voting [2], [9].  
  - As of early 2024, Aave’s governance participation rate is approximately 2.4%, with a significant portion of delegated votes not being cast [2].  
  - High gas fees further discourage small token holders from participating [2].

In response, the Aave community is exploring alternatives such as Layer 2 solutions or off-chain Snapshot voting to implement “gasless voting” [10] and is conducting research to enhance participation incentives [2].

### 1.3 Arbitrum DAO Case

Arbitrum, a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, initiated its DAO governance by airdropping ARB tokens in March 2023 [3].

- **Strengths**:  
  Arbitrum has built a decentralized governance base by distributing tokens widely among users from the outset.
  
- **Issues**:  
  - Its initial governance proposal (AIP-1) was overly extensive and complex, causing confusion among voters [3].  
  - The allocation of 750 million ARB tokens to the foundation prior to community approval undermined trust in the DAO’s decentralization [3], [11].  
  - Consequently, the foundation had to reorganize the proposal process by segmenting contentious issues and conducting re-votes [3].

### Table 1. Summary of Recent DAO Cases and Governance Challenges

| DAO Case         | Key Features                                                        | Governance Issues                                                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MakerDAO**     | Decentralized stablecoin issuance and lending (governed by MKR token) | Low voter participation due to whale dominance; complex proposals; excessive founder influence [1] |
| **Aave DAO**     | Decentralized DeFi lending platform (governed by AAVE token)          | Very low voter turnout (~2.4%); high gas fees deterring small holders; concentration of votes among whales [2], [9] |
| **Arbitrum DAO** | Layer-2 governance for Ethereum (ARB token launched in 2023)          | Overly extensive initial proposal; pre-approved token transfers undermining trust [3], [11] |

## 2. AI-Based Improvement Strategies for DAOs

The challenges in DAO governance—including information overload, lack of expertise, and low participation—can be mitigated through the application of AI technologies [7]. This section outlines several AI-based strategies to enhance DAO governance.

### 2.1 NLP-Based Proposal and Discussion Summarization

Governance proposals and forum discussions in DAOs are often extensive.  
By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, lengthy proposals and discussions can be summarized to quickly extract key points [1].

- **Benefits**:  
  Reduces information overload and enables rapid comprehension of core issues.
  
- **Applications**:  
  - MakerDAO is planning to deploy a Governance AI tool (GAIT) as part of its Endgame Plan [1].  
  - The Aave community uses an AI summarization bot (x23) to condense forum discussions [6].  
  - NEAR Protocol’s governance team has implemented an AI-powered chatbot to provide real-time Q&A support [6].

### 2.2 AI-Based Decision Support System

An AI-based decision support system can learn from historical outcomes of similar proposals, thereby predicting the potential benefits and risks of new proposals. Additionally, real-time analysis of on-chain and market data can detect anomalies and recommend optimal alternatives.

- **Applications**:  
  - MakerDAO’s GAIT tool assists with proposal summarization, data verification, and even the generation of new proposals [6].  
  - Platforms such as Aave and Compound are employing simulation-based risk assessment tools developed by Gauntlet [4].

### 2.3 AI-Based Automated Voting and Delegated Voting System

To combat low voter turnout, it has been proposed that token holders delegate their voting rights to AI agents.

- **Features**:  
  - AI agents automatically cast votes based on pre-configured criteria or user preferences.  
  - They operate continuously, ensuring timely responses to proposals, including urgent matters.
  
- **Applications**:  
  - Ocean Protocol has introduced a concept for AI proxy voting [5].  
  - Research is ongoing to use AI-based delegated voting to compensate for low quorum issues [5].

> **Note**: When implementing AI automated voting systems, it is imperative to integrate human verification mechanisms (e.g., Proof of Humanity or On-chain Captcha) to prevent Sybil attacks and misuse [5].

### 2.4 AI Agent-Assisted Forum Activity and Decision-Making Support

DAO governance encompasses not only voting but also the discussion and formulation of proposals.  
AI agents can enhance these processes as follows:

- **Automated Q&A**:  
  AI chatbots can respond in real time to repetitive queries from new participants, thereby improving overall community understanding [6].
  
- **Discussion Monitoring and Summarization**:  
  AI can analyze extensive forum discussions and provide concise summaries of the pros and cons [6].
  
- **Content Moderation**:  
  AI-based spam filters and content moderators help maintain a productive discussion environment [6].

### 2.5 Other AI Applications

- **Simulation-Based Decision Evaluation and Predictive Modeling**:  
  Reinforcement learning agents can simulate various market conditions to evaluate the potential impact and risks of DAO strategies.
  
- **Smart Contract Code Analysis**:  
  AI-driven code reviews and security auditing tools can detect bugs or potential backdoors in smart contracts.
  
- **AI Financial Manager/Project Manager**:  
  AI systems could manage treasury funds in real time or dynamically adjust resource allocation based on project performance.

## 3. Future Outlook of DAOs with AI

The integration of AI and DAOs presents both opportunities and challenges [7].  
AI has the potential to transform DAOs into more efficient and inclusive organizations; however, ethical, technical, and legal risks necessitate a cautious approach.

### 3.1 Development and Impact of AI-Based DAOs

- **Maximizing Decision-Making Efficiency**:  
  Leveraging AI for information processing and collective intelligence allows DAOs to respond more rapidly than traditional organizations.
  
- **Lowering Participation Barriers**:  
  By delegating complex tasks to AI agents, governance can be made more accessible to non-experts.
  
- **Enhancing Autonomy**:  
  Over time, AI may automate a significant portion of DAO operations, leading to self-optimizing, round-the-clock organizations.

Moreover, AI-integrated DAOs have the potential to introduce innovative business models and new forms of social contracts that could catalyze transformative changes in economic systems [7].

### 3.2 Evaluation of Ethical, Technical, and Legal Risks

- **Ethical Concerns**:  
  Issues such as bias in AI training data and algorithms, as well as the potential exclusion of qualitative human judgment in decision-making.
  
- **Technical Concerns**:  
  Risks related to system malfunctions, bugs, and vulnerabilities to hacking attacks.
  
- **Legal Concerns**:  
  Ambiguities regarding accountability when AI is involved in decision-making, and potential regulatory challenges.

A multi-faceted approach that includes fairness audits, human oversight, robust security measures, and legal clarity is essential when incorporating AI into DAO governance.

## Conclusion

This paper has examined recent DAO cases (e.g., MakerDAO, Aave, Arbitrum) and explored various AI-based improvement strategies to enhance DAO governance.  
The findings indicate that AI-driven solutions—such as NLP-based summarization, decision support systems, and automated voting—can help alleviate issues related to low participation and inefficient decision-making.  
Nevertheless, it is crucial to manage the associated technical, ethical, and legal risks rigorously. In summary, the convergence of DAOs and AI is expected to evolve into a more inclusive and efficient governance model, paving the way for innovative business models and new forms of social contracts.
