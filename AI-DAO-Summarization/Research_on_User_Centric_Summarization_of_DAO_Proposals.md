## User-Centric Summarization for DAO Proposals

### Introduction
User-specific summarization involves tailoring summaries based on a user’s background, interests, and preferences. This approach enhances user engagement and ensures the content is relevant and comprehensible for the intended audience.

This document outlines the methods and workflow to implement user-centric summarization for DAO proposals.

### Approach for User-Specific Summarization

#### 1. User Profiling
To provide tailored summaries, the system gathers information about the user:
- **Interests**: Topics or categories the user frequently engages with (e.g., governance, technology, finance).
- **Background Knowledge**: User's familiarity with specific concepts (e.g., beginner, intermediate, expert).
- **Interaction History**: Analyzing past voting patterns, comments, and time spent on proposals.

**Implementation**:
- Store user data in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- Utilize tools like **Scikit-learn** or **TensorFlow Recommenders** for clustering and recommendation based on past behavior.

#### 2. Proposal Classification
Before summarization, categorize proposals into relevant topics or domains (e.g., finance, technical upgrades) to match them with user interests.

**Example**:
Use an NLP model like **BERT** for topic classification:
```python
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")

categories = ["governance", "finance", "technology", "community"]
text = "This proposal focuses on allocating funds for AI-based decision-making systems."
result = classifier(text, candidate_labels=categories)
print(result)
```
This will output the proposal's relevance to each category, allowing the system to align it with user interests.

#### 3. Adaptive Summarization
Summaries can be adjusted based on the user’s background knowledge:
- **Beginners**: Use simpler language and explain technical terms.
- **Experts**: Focus on key points, avoiding unnecessary explanations.

**Implementation**:
Use GPT-4-turbo with prompt engineering to adjust the language complexity:
```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

def generate_summary(text, user_level):
    prompt = f"""
    Summarize the following proposal for a {user_level}:
    {text}
    """
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant that adapts summaries to the user's expertise."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ]
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

text = "This proposal focuses on integrating blockchain for supply chain management..."
summary = generate_summary(text, user_level="beginner")
print(summary)
```
Adjust the `user_level` to "beginner", "intermediate", or "expert" based on the user profile.

---

#### 4. Dynamic Highlights
Highlight sections of the summary based on the user's interests:
- **Governance-focused users**: Emphasize voting mechanisms or impact on decision-making.
- **Technical users**: Highlight implementation details and technical challenges.

**Implementation**:
Use **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to extract relevant information:
```python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

text = "This proposal suggests allocating $1M for AI integration, improving efficiency by 20%."
doc = nlp(text)
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)  # Extract entities like money, percentages, or key terms
```
Highlight these entities in the final summary for relevance.

### Proposed Workflow

1. **Input**: User profile (background, interests) + Proposal text.
2. **Classification**: Identify the proposal's domain.
3. **Personalization**:
   - Adapt language complexity based on user expertise.
   - Focus on topics of interest.
4. **Output**: Deliver a customized summary with relevant highlights.

### Challenges and Solutions

| **Challenge**                           | **Solution**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Insufficient user data**              | Use cold-start strategies (ask user preferences directly or use default settings). |
| **Scalability for large user bases**    | Optimize database queries and use caching mechanisms.                        |
| **Balancing relevance and completeness**| Set thresholds for summary length and priority based on user interaction feedback. |

### Example Output

**Proposal Text**:
> "This proposal allocates $1M to develop AI-based tools for automating governance processes. Expected benefits include a 20% increase in voting participation and reduced manual oversight."

**Beginner-Level Summary**:
> "The proposal suggests spending $1M to create AI tools that make governance easier by automating processes. This will help more people vote and reduce the need for manual work."

**Expert-Level Summary**:
> "This proposal allocates $1M for AI-driven automation of governance processes, targeting a 20% increase in voter participation and enhanced operational efficiency."

This tailored approach ensures that each user gets the most relevant and comprehensible information, improving their engagement and decision-making within DAOs.
