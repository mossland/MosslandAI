# AI-Powered DAO Research Repository

## Overview

This repository contains research and development efforts focused on leveraging AI to enhance DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governance, including user profiling, proposal summarization, and case studies of AI implementations in DAO ecosystems. Our goal is to improve participation, decision-making efficiency, and governance transparency through AI-driven solutions.

## Research Topics

### 1. AI-Based User Profiling & DAO Summary System

- **Description**: This study explores AI-driven methods to analyze user tendencies in DAO governance. By understanding voting behaviors and preferences, the system delivers personalized summaries and recommendations to enhance user engagement.

### 4. Optimizing the Interface between AI Agents and DAO Users
- **Description**: This study explores the design and development of AI-driven user interfaces tailored for DAO environments. It focuses on enhancing the interaction between DAO users and AI agents through NLP, conversational UIs, and adaptive interfaces to improve governance engagement and efficiency.

### 5. DAO-Focused Multi-Document Summarization System Design
- **Description**: As Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) grow in complexity, they generate diverse text data across multiple platforms (on-chain voting records, forums, internal repositories, etc.). Efficiently summarizing these documents is crucial for effective governance, decision-making, and community engagement.
