# AI-Powered DAO Research Repository

## Overview

This repository contains research and development efforts focused on leveraging AI to enhance DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governance, including user profiling, proposal summarization, and case studies of AI implementations in DAO ecosystems. Our goal is to improve participation, decision-making efficiency, and governance transparency through AI-driven solutions.

## Research Topics

### 1. AI-Based User Profiling & DAO Summary System
