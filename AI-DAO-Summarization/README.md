# Research on User-Centric Summarization of DAO Proposals

## Introduction
In Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), governance relies heavily on user participation through proposal reviews and voting. However, participation rates often suffer due to the complexity and volume of proposals. Automating the summarization of proposals in a user-centric manner can address this problem by providing concise, personalized summaries tailored to individual users' interests and engagement patterns.

This document outlines the necessary technologies, APIs, methodologies, advantages, limitations, and references to related research.

## Technologies and Methodologies

### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Purpose**: Extract and summarize the core content of proposals.
- **Approaches**:
  - **Extractive Summarization**: Identifying key sentences or phrases directly from the proposal.
  - **Abstractive Summarization**: Generating human-like summaries that paraphrase the original text.
- **Recommended Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers): Provides pre-trained models like BERT, T5, and GPT-3 for summarization.
  - [spaCy](https://spacy.io/): Useful for preprocessing and entity recognition.
  - [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) or [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/): Lightweight solutions for extractive summarization.
- **Example API**:
  - [OpenAI GPT-3 API](https://openai.com/api) (e.g., `text-davinci`) for advanced abstractive summarization.
  - [Google Cloud Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language) for keyword extraction and sentiment analysis.

### 2. Personalization Engine
- **Purpose**: Tailor summaries based on user profiles, voting history, and interests.
- **Approaches**:
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommending proposals based on user similarity.
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Matching proposals to user interests derived from past interactions.
  - **Contextual Bandits**: Dynamic recommendation adjustments based on real-time user feedback.
- **Recommended Tools**:
  - [TensorFlow Recommenders](https://www.tensorflow.org/recommenders): For building personalized ranking and recommendation models.
  - [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): For lightweight user clustering and profiling.

### 3. Ranking and Prioritization Algorithms
- **Purpose**: Rank proposals by relevance to a user.
- **Techniques**:
  - **TF-IDF**: Simple relevance scoring based on term frequency.
  - **Neural Re-ranking**: Using BERT or Sentence-BERT for semantic similarity scoring.
- **Example API**:
  - [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) or [Apache Solr](https://solr.apache.org/) for indexing and ranking proposals with advanced search capabilities.

## Workflow

1. **Proposal Ingestion**:
   - Proposals are collected from DAO platforms and converted into structured text.
   - **APIs**: DAO-specific APIs or web scraping tools like [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/).

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization, stopword removal, and entity recognition using `spaCy` or `NLTK`.

3. **Summarization**:
   - Use a pre-trained NLP model (e.g., T5, GPT-3) to generate summaries.
   - **Example Pipeline**:
     ```python
     from transformers import pipeline
     summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="t5-base")
     summary = summarizer("Full proposal text here", max_length=100, min_length=30)
     print(summary)
     ```

4. **Personalization**:
   - Match summaries to users using collaborative filtering.
   - Store and analyze user activity via a database like PostgreSQL.

5. **Output Delivery**:
   - Summaries are delivered via a UI or sent as notifications.
   - Frontend integration with frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for a seamless user experience.

## Summarization Code Examples

### 1. `summarization_pipeline.py`
This script uses Hugging Face's `transformers` library and `spaCy` for preprocessing and summarization of DAO proposals. It demonstrates how to clean the input text and summarize it using pre-trained models like T5.

**Key Features**:
- Preprocesses text using `spaCy` for tokenization and sentence segmentation.
- Generates summaries with Hugging Face's T5 model.

**Example Use**:
```bash
python summarization_pipeline.py
```

### 2. `summarization_pipeline_openai.py`
This script integrates OpenAI's GPT-4-turbo API for summarization tasks. It provides a more dynamic and context-aware summary generation, leveraging OpenAI's advanced language models.

**Key Features**:
- Utilizes spaCy for text preprocessing.
- Sends cleaned text to OpenAI's ChatGPT API for high-quality summarization.

**Example Use**:
```bash
python summarization_pipeline_openai.py
```

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the time required for users to understand proposals.
- **Increased Participation**: Tailored summaries encourage user engagement.
- **Scalability**: NLP models can handle large numbers of proposals.

### Limitations
- **Model Bias**: NLP models may favor certain types of content.
- **Personalization Overhead**: Maintaining accurate user profiles requires significant data engineering.
- **API Costs**: Using APIs like OpenAI can be expensive for large-scale deployments.
