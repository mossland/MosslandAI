## Latest Research Highlights

Our most recent initiatives are centered on enhancing DAO efficiency and user engagement through AI-driven tools. Below are the key projects and their core contributions:

### 1. AI-Based User Profiling & DAO Summary System
- **Description**:  
  This research uses AI to analyze user behaviors within DAO governance. By understanding voting patterns and preferences, it generates personalized summaries and recommendations, boosting engagement and informed decision-making.

### 5. DAO-Focused Multi-Document Summarization System Design
- **Description**:  
  As DAOs generate diverse text data—from on-chain records to community discussions—this project designs a system to consolidate and summarize information from multiple sources. The goal is to support more informed decision-making and enhance transparency.
- **Resources**:
  - [DAO_Multi_Doc_Summarization_System_Design.md](./AI-DAO-Summarization/DAO_Multi_Doc_Summarization_System_Design.md)

### 6. DAO User Scenario Flow Diagrams
- **Description**:  
  This initiative presents illustrative flow diagrams of user scenarios within a DAO. It maps out AI-driven processes that facilitate governance and improve member interactions.
- **Resources**:
  - [DAO_User_Scenario_Flow_Diagrams.md](./AI-DAO-Summarization/DAO_User_Scenario_Flow_Diagrams.md)

### 7. Optimizing AI Agent Access to Blockchain Smart Contracts
- **Description**:  
  Focusing on the technical integration of AI with blockchain, this project investigates efficient methods for AI agents to query on-chain data, execute transactions, and interact with smart contracts. It aims to refine both smart contract design and AI agent performance.
- **Resources**:
  - [Optimizing_AI_Agent_Access_to_Blockchain_Smart_Contracts.md](./AI-DAO-Summarization/Optimizing_AI_Agent_Access_to_Blockchain_Smart_Contracts/Optimizing_AI_Agent_Access_to_Blockchain_Smart_Contracts.md)
