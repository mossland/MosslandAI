# From Enterprise BaaS to a Public Blockchain: Considerations for Introducing Ethereum in Luniverse

## 1. Introduction

The blockchain service platform **Luniverse** is an enterprise **Blockchain as a Service (BaaS)** provided by the Korean company **Lambda256** that allows anyone to easily build blockchain networks and decentralized applications (DApps). Leveraging an intuitive GUI‑based development environment, high‑performance sidechains, and a *pay‑as‑you‑go* billing model, it has attracted numerous enterprise blockchain projects \[1].

However, while Luniverse’s architectural design and **Proof‑of‑Authority (PoA)** consensus offer stability and operational convenience as an enterprise BaaS, some argue that additional supplementation is required in terms of certain functions and ecosystem breadth compared with public blockchains—especially **Ethereum**.

This report reviews the current state of the Luniverse platform from technical and operational perspectives and summarizes key points that Luniverse‑based projects should consider when contemplating a move to the Ethereum mainnet or Ethereum‑based **Layer 2 (L2)** networks.

## 2. Overview and Architecture of the Luniverse Platform

Luniverse adopts a **layered blockchain architecture**. The Luniverse network operates in an L2 structure composed of the mainnet called **“The Balance”** and independent sidechains for each service. The mainnet uses PoA, with up to **25 validator nodes** (partners) participating in block production and verifying the final state changes of the entire Luniverse ecosystem.

Each DApp runs on its own **sidechain** separate from the mainnet, using an independent execution environment that does not share computing resources or network bandwidth with others. This enables each DApp to secure performance of up to several thousand **TPS** and one‑second block times while processing transactions with **no gas fees**. Data processed on sidechains is periodically **rolled up (anchored)** to the mainnet, thereby ensuring both high‑speed processing and data integrity \[1].

Within this structure, Luniverse provides developers with a one‑stop blockchain development console, standard **Solidity** smart‑contract templates, various **APIs**, and wallet‑management tools so that “developers with limited blockchain knowledge can easily develop and operate DApps.” In short, Luniverse is a platform that provides enterprise‑optimized performance and convenience through a **“consortium mainnet + sidechains”** configuration. This design has significantly lowered the barrier to initial blockchain adoption, but several important differences exist when compared with public blockchains.

The Luniverse structure has played a key role in helping enterprises adopt blockchain technology safely and quickly, especially in industries where regulatory compliance is critical. However, further considerations remain in terms of **global scalability** and **ecosystem diversity**.

## 3. Structural Characteristics of Luniverse (Compared with Ethereum)

### 3.1 Size of the Developer Ecosystem and Community

Luniverse emphasizes developer convenience for enterprise clients, offering a GUI‑centric development environment and a set of pre‑built APIs. However, as a **managed platform**, it may have limitations in broadly attracting participation and contributions from the global open‑source developer community.

For example, **Ethereum** boasts the world’s largest blockchain‑developer community, with about **25 %** of all developers—roughly **2.5 times** more than runner‑up **Polkadot** \[2]. The Ethereum ecosystem supports thousands of full‑time developers and a vast number of open‑source projects, libraries, and tools, creating an enormous pool of collective intelligence. By contrast, public partner lists show about **100 Luniverse projects**, most of them Korean start‑ups or affiliates, and spontaneous global open‑source contributions are still rare.

On Ethereum, anyone can code and deploy new protocols—**DeFi, NFTs, DAOs**, and more—driving community‑led innovation. Development on Luniverse, in contrast, tends to rely on the provided **standard templates and APIs** \[1]. While this boosts stability and productivity in the early stages, separate extensions may be needed for highly customized or groundbreaking functions.

Ultimately, Luniverse has ample room to grow as an open ecosystem that harnesses global collective intelligence. Although this could affect the platform’s pace of advancement and diversity, its managed‑platform approach undeniably provides stability and technical support that reduce risk for enterprise users during the early phases of blockchain adoption.

### 3.2 Differences in Global Scalability and User Accessibility

“Global scalability” encompasses far more than TPS; it also refers to the universality required to accommodate users worldwide. Although Luniverse boosts TPS through sidechain‑based scaling, its **restricted‑participation** network means additional considerations are required when compared with Ethereum, where anyone can freely participate.

Tokens or NFTs issued on Luniverse cannot be used immediately on global platforms outside the network. For example, NFTs minted on Luniverse cannot be traded directly on **OpenSea**, the world’s largest NFT marketplace. To resolve this, **Lambda256** launched a **multi‑chain NFT bridge** in 2022 that converts Luniverse NFTs into the **ERC‑721** standard so they can be traded on OpenSea \[3]. While this expands links with public chains, the additional UX and operational steps must be optimized.

Lambda256 says it is “expanding the Luniverse ecosystem through linkage with Ethereum” and plans to enhance interoperability with other mainnets in the future \[3]. Accordingly, Luniverse projects that aim to attract global users must pursue **multi‑chain strategies** or **bridge utilization**, and the UX and operational burden increases in the process, making step‑by‑step bridge optimization important.

By contrast, the **Ethereum mainnet** is a universal platform that millions of people worldwide can access with a single wallet. As of 2025, the network had more than **120 million active addresses** (30‑day transaction window), and hundreds of thousands of new wallets are created each week \[4]. When Ethereum’s L2 networks are included, users can employ L2 while still enjoying an integrated experience as part of the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

### 3.3 Governance and Network Trust

Because Luniverse employs PoA, validator selection and network governance are **centralized**. Up to 25 authorized partner nodes create blocks on the Luniverse mainnet, and these are entities trusted by Lambda256. With so few participants, users must trust a small validator set (and, by extension, the operator). Should these entities decide to change policies, others may struggle to respond. For example, upgrades or rule changes provide relatively few channels for token holders or DApp developers to voice their opinions officially.

By contrast, after Ethereum switched to **PoS** in 2022, more than **one million** validator nodes globally now co‑operate the network. This level of decentralization prevents unilateral change and ensures neutrality. Governance proceeds through open **Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)** discussions—which, though slow and complex, serve as the basis for community trust. Institutional investors often cite Ethereum’s decentralization and neutrality in preferring Ethereum DeFi \[5].

### 3.4 Token Economics and Liquidity

The liquidity of tokens and NFTs issued on Luniverse remains **limited** compared with Ethereum. Although Luniverse allows easy token issuance, assets often stay confined within its ecosystem. Lambda256 provides technical links with Korean exchanges such as **Upbit** and **Coinone**, but these are limited to certain domestic exchanges partnered with Lambda256. Few global exchanges or DeFi protocols list Luniverse‑specific tokens. Projects must issue mirrored **ERC‑20** versions or convert via bridges, increasing operational overhead, security considerations, and potential user confusion.

In Ethereum’s ecosystem, these complexities are largely mitigated. **ERC‑20** tokens can list immediately on global DEXes like **Uniswap** and on hundreds of centralized exchanges. They can be used as collateral in numerous DeFi protocols. As of 2025, Ethereum accounts for about **55 %** of total DeFi **TVL**, outpacing competitors such as **Solana** thanks to its modular expansion approach \[5].

Such liquidity gaps directly affect token‑value formation and user‑adoption growth. **Gartner** projects that blockchain technology will generate more than **USD 3.1 trillion** in business value by 2030 \[6]. Without direct access to global liquidity networks, projects risk missing out on that immense value. Accordingly, Luniverse projects require strategic planning.

In short, Luniverse‑based tokens currently tend to remain limited to payment or membership functions inside services, whereas migration to an Ethereum‑standard asset could simultaneously deliver liquidity, utility, and greater market trust.


## 4. Considerations for Operating a Hybrid Model Linking Ethereum L2

Some have suggested—rather than a complete migration to Ethereum—running Luniverse in a **hybrid** manner by attaching an Ethereum‑based **Layer 2 (L2)** to the Luniverse mainnet. In this concept, internal transactions would continue to be processed on Luniverse sidechains, while external trades or asset transfers would be handled through an Ethereum‑family L2. At first glance, the plan appears to combine Luniverse’s low‑cost, high‑speed processing with Ethereum’s global network effects. Yet, when one considers technical realities and operational complexity, the following issues arise:

* **Increased technical complexity**  Connecting two disparate systems—Luniverse chains and an Ethereum L2—requires additional infrastructure such as bridge smart contracts, relay servers, and monitoring systems. Luniverse already has its own mainnet‑sidechain architecture and roll‑up mechanism \[7]; adding another L2 layer could entangle data‑synchronization and security‑consensus models. For instance, even if the state of a Luniverse sidechain were periodically withdrawn to an Ethereum L2, this would not automatically grant the Luniverse mainnet (PoA) the cryptographic proofs native to Ethereum. Trust in the Luniverse realm would still rest on a small validator set, while the L2 would derive security separately from Ethereum, creating a dual system whose overall consistency would be hard to guarantee. To truly incorporate the Luniverse mainnet into an L2, a large‑scale overhaul—effectively rolling up (anchoring) the Luniverse mainnet to Ethereum—would be required. Rebuilding Luniverse with Ethereum‑based **ZK‑rollup** or **optimistic‑rollup** technology would demand enormous investment and time.

* **Operational complexity and cost**  Operating two heterogeneous networks in parallel would likely increase the burden of infrastructure management, monitoring, and upgrades. Separate maintenance of Luniverse nodes and L2 nodes would be required, and at minimum the state of all chains would have to be tracked. Troubleshooting would also become more difficult. From a user‑experience perspective, ordinary users of a DApp might find it hard to grasp which parts are processed on Luniverse and which on the L2. When using tokens, they might have to go through swap procedures between Luniverse‑native tokens and wrapped tokens on Ethereum. Such multi‑step flows can create user confusion and reduce the appeal of a “pure” decentralized‑service approach.

* **Limitations that remain only partially solved**  A Luniverse–L2 hybrid model would alleviate some of the previously noted constraints only in part. For example, token‑liquidity issues might be eased because DEX trading on the chosen L2 (e.g., Arbitrum or Polygon) would become possible, yet the tokens would still remain separated from the ultimate global hub, Ethereum mainnet. Likewise, the development ecosystem might still struggle to be fully integrated with Ethereum’s core community, leaving residual gaps. For many resource‑limited projects, the cost–benefit ratio of maintaining a complex hybrid architecture may not justify itself, and switching outright to a public chain could prove the more efficient alternative.

Especially for start‑ups and projects whose resources are limited, concentrating all roles on a single, well‑established platform can be more desirable than sustaining a complex hybrid architecture.

In short, while the Luniverse–Ethereum L2 mixed approach is an intriguing idea, its implementation difficulty is high, and its practical benefits may vary depending on a project’s scale and resources. Paradoxically, such discussions can serve as evidence of the need for a **complete migration to Ethereum**.

## 5. Considerations When Migrating from Luniverse to Ethereum

Based on the analysis above, the advantages to be gained—and the factors to be weighed—when moving from Luniverse to the Ethereum mainnet (or to an Ethereum‑based Layer 2) can be summarized from technical, ecosystem, and user‑experience perspectives as follows:

* **Enhanced technical stability and security**  The Ethereum mainnet, launched in 2015, has proved its stability and security through many years of real‑world operation. The adoption of **EIP‑1559** (London 2021) and the 2022 transition to **PoS**, followed by the ongoing sharding roadmap, have steadily improved performance while ensuring modular scalability \[5]. From the standpoint of public‑chain durability, Ethereum offers a particularly well‑proven foundation.

  Using Ethereum **L2** solutions (e.g., **Arbitrum**, **Optimism**) lets projects enjoy TPS on par with Luniverse and pay very low fees while still benefiting from the ultimate safety net of Ethereum L1. Thanks to **proto‑danksharding** introduced in the March 2024 **Dencun** upgrade, L2 data‑storage costs have plummeted, with many L2 transaction fees falling anywhere from roughly **65 % to more than 98 %**. Hence, in terms of asset security and network longevity, migrating to Ethereum can be a sound choice.

* **Entry into a vast ecosystem and global compatibility**  Moving to Ethereum means joining the world’s largest public‑blockchain ecosystem. As noted earlier, Ethereum hosts several thousand developers, hundreds of millions of wallet addresses, and thousands of active **DApps** \[4]\[6]. The network effects of joining this environment are immense. For example, tokens minted after an Ethereum migration can list more easily on major global exchanges, be accepted as collateral across a variety of **DeFi** protocols, and combine (via **composability**) with other DApps to create entirely new services.

  For **NFTs**, immediate trading becomes possible on leading marketplaces such as **OpenSea** and **Blur**; for **ERC‑20** tokens, liquidity pools on **Uniswap**, **Curve**, and other protocols provide opportunities for global exchange. In short, migration lays the groundwork for expanding a project’s value onto the world stage—something worth examining carefully from the standpoint of ecosystem connectivity.

* **Improved user experience (UX)**   Services built on Luniverse may require users to perform extra steps, such as installing a dedicated wallet app or adding a custom **RPC** network in **MetaMask** \[9]. By contrast, after migrating to Ethereum, you can bring in existing Ethereum‑wallet users right away, and wallet‑compatibility issues disappear. Popular wallets like MetaMask and **WalletConnect** natively support the Ethereum mainnet and major L2s, so users can access DApps without any additional configuration.
  
  In addition, familiar tools such as **Etherscan**, Ethereum’s block explorer, allow users to check transactions and manage accounts in an environment they already trust. International users likewise tend to place greater confidence and feel more at ease with services running on Ethereum than with those on little‑known local platforms. Tokens display correctly in wallets when they conform to Ethereum standards, and NFTs link immediately to global profiles on **OpenSea** and similar sites, resulting in a smoother overall UX.
  
  As for payments and fees, Luniverse advertises zero gas per transaction, but costs still arise in the form of **BaaS** usage charges or other fees. When an Ethereum L2 is used, users pay a small amount of gas themselves, yet the service operates under a transparent fee structure; furthermore, as mentioned earlier, L2 fees dropped dramatically after the 2024 **Dencun** upgrade (by more than **98 %** on some L2s), so the burden on users is now very low \[10]. In short, migrating to Ethereum can be a strategy worth serious consideration, as it enables projects to deliver UX and trust that align with global standards.
  
The Ethereum ecosystem continues to strengthen its competitiveness through steady technological innovation in the mid‑2020s.
The Dencun upgrade completed in March 2024 introduced proto‑danksharding (EIP‑4844), which greatly reduced data‑storage costs for L2 solutions; as a result, transaction fees on many L2s fell by between 65 % and as much as 98 %, dramatically improving user experience.
The Pectra upgrade applied in May 2025 then introduced account abstraction, allowing gas fees to be paid with tokens other than ETH, and expanded the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH—a 64‑fold increase—thereby enhancing the efficiency of large‑scale staking operations [8].

Lower barriers on both cost and UX have rapidly increased corporate and institutional willingness to adopt public chains.
According to KPMG’s 2024 blockchain report, 68 % of respondents from financial institutions and large enterprises said they “plan to integrate public‑chain infrastructure within the next three years.” [11]

## 6. Conclusion

Luniverse offers ease of initial adoption and high TPS, but as a project grows and its target user base expands, connections to the public‑blockchain ecosystem become crucial. Ethereum involves millions of participants worldwide and plays a central role in Web3 innovation; the benefits of its open ecosystem are difficult for a closed platform to replicate fully. A hybrid plan that tries to attach an Ethereum L2 to Luniverse has been considered, yet such an approach may leave some core issues only partially resolved.

A clearer course of action is to migrate directly to the Ethereum mainnet or an L2. Technically, this path is simpler and, over the long term, can be less costly. By moving to a public chain, a project can more easily attract global users and capital, leverage the collective intelligence of the developer community, and secure long‑term sustainability through decentralized infrastructure.

In short, migration to the Ethereum network deserves serious consideration from technical, ecosystem, and UX perspectives. Doing so would maximize the value and liquidity of the project’s token and, ultimately, increase the likelihood of project success.
